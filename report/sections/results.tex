Due to constraints on time and available data, we were not able to verify our results.

Since our main claim is that existing systems give wrong recommendations, we cannot simply compare our results with the results of IMDb, trakt or Netflix.
Thus, we would need to set up an experiment that asks people to give feedback on the recommendations our system produces, while using the recommendations of IMDb (or a similar source) as a control group.
