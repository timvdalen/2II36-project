\subsection{TFIDF to enhance correlation results}
Using a simple regex expression we search for mentions of movies in comments. 
The results from this search are surprisingly accurate but also include quite some noise. 
This is noise is the result of mentions of movie actors, characters and movie titles that are contained as a substring from other movie titles. 

Examples:
Search for “Lord of the Rings” has “The Ring” as a substring, which is also a actual movie, resulting a bad correlation (in this case that is). 
Mentions about the movie “Spiderman” often include references to the protagonist “Peter Parker”. However “Parker” is also the name of a movie and therefore also results in a bad correlation.

To enhance our results we could use TFIDF to differentiate between the importance of correlations. 
Given a set of correlations: C = {“Lord of the Rings”, “The Ring”, “Pirates of the Carribean”} for movie M = “The Hobbit”
We would look for movie titles contained in set C that are a substring of another movie in this set C OR a subset of the movie title M. 
In this case: t1 = “The Ring” is a substring of t2 = “Lord of the Rings”
We now calculating the total TFIDF score of both t1 and t2 for document set C(M): movie comments for movie M.
We now compare the score of two movie titles and reason as follows:
if TFIDF(t1) <= TFIDF(t2) one could say that both are almost equally “important” giving the score.
But since t1 substring of t2, t2 is more discriminative than t1 and therefore giving a stronger correlation for movie M. 
We can now remove t1 from the set of correlations C.
