Trakt is a web service that lets people track what TV shows and movies they have watched.
It is known for its well-structured - though unfortunately not so highly available - API.

Trakt gets data about movies and TV shows from TMDb, a site that scrapes IMDb and makes movie data easier available.
Users of Trakt can leave reviews and comments (called shouts) on movies.

We use the Trakt API to get all reviews and shouts for movies that we are interested in.

\subsection{Reddit}
